This repository contains my work and completed exercises from the **Python DB** module at SoftUni (January 2025 session).

During this module, I gained practical experience in working with relational databases using **PostgreSQL** and applied **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)** techniques in Python through **Django** and **SQLAlchemy**.  
The module was divided into two main parts: working directly with SQL databases, and working with databases through Python ORM frameworks.

## PostgreSQL Course

In the first part of the module, I focused on relational databases using **PostgreSQL**. I learned how to:

- Design and manage relational database schemas.
- Create and manipulate tables using SQL.
- Perform basic **CRUD** operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Use built-in PostgreSQL functions for data manipulation and analysis.
- Aggregate and group data efficiently.
- Establish relationships between tables using foreign keys and JOIN operations.
- Write subqueries for complex data retrieval.
- Manage transactions and implement database programmability features like stored procedures.

### Topics I Covered
- PostgreSQL Introduction: Data Types and Working with Tables
- Basic CRUD Operations
- Built-in Functions
- Data Aggregation
- Table Relations
- Subqueries and JOINs
- Database Programmability and Transactions
- Exam Preparation

### Exercises Completed
- Working with Tables and Data Types
- CRUD Operations
- Built-in Functions
- Data Aggregation and Grouping
- Table Relations
- Subqueries and JOINs
- Transactions and Procedures

### Certificate

*(Certificate awarded upon successful completion of the PostgreSQL course.)*

## Python ORM (Django and SQLAlchemy)

The second part of the module focused on working with databases through ORM frameworks, where I applied Python's object-oriented principles to database interaction.

Key achievements:

- Built Django models and mapped them to database tables.
- Managed database migrations and administered data through Django Admin.
- Performed complex data queries using Djangoâ€™s ORM.
- Created and managed model relationships (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many).
- Customized and extended Django models through inheritance.
- Implemented advanced query techniques for performance and flexibility.
- Gained initial experience with **SQLAlchemy** for ORM outside the Django framework.

### Topics I Covered
- ORM Introduction
- Django Models Basics
- Migrations and Django Admin
- Data Operations with Django Queries
- Advanced Query Techniques
- Model Relationships and Inheritance
- SQLAlchemy ORM Usage
- Exam Preparation
- Workshops: Building Django Projects

### Exercises Completed
- Django Models and Migrations
- CRUD Operations with Django
- Advanced Queries and Relations
- SQLAlchemy ORM Basics

### Certificate

*(Certificate awarded upon successful completion of the Python ORM course.)*
